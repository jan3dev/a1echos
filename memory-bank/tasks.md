## 📄 ARCHIVE DOCUMENTATION

**Archive Document**: [memory-bank/archive/archive-background-recording-incognito-cleanup.md](archive/archive-background-recording-incognito-cleanup.md)  
**Date Archived**: 2024-12-19  
**Final Status**: COMPLETED & ARCHIVED

### Archive Summary
Comprehensive documentation of the background recording and incognito session cleanup feature, including:
- Complete technical implementation details
- Architectural decisions and design patterns
- Testing validation and success metrics
- Lessons learned and future considerations
- Cross-references to reflection and progress documents

## 📝 FINAL REFLECTION HIGHLIGHTS

- **What Went Well**: Systematic problem-solving approach, root cause discovery, architectural simplification, comprehensive testing with user feedback, debug logging integration, multiple safety nets for bulletproof solution
- **Challenges**: Initial over-engineering attempts, hidden lifecycle interference, notification state management, incognito session edge cases across multiple app flows, two-way communication between isolates
- **Lessons Learned**: Keep background services simple, automatic lifecycle responses can interfere with user intent, multiple cleanup triggers needed for bulletproof session management, finding root cause more valuable than complex workarounds
- **Next Steps**: Production monitoring, user documentation, code review, performance testing for extended recording sessions
