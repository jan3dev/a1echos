# Progress

## Project Setup and Documentation
- ✅ Created Memory Bank structure for maintaining project knowledge
- ✅ Documented project brief with key objectives and features
- ✅ Set up technical context documentation
- ✅ Established system patterns documentation
- ✅ Created active context tracking
- ✅ Implemented progress tracking
- ✅ Documented product context

## Project Analysis
- ✅ Initial project structure analysis
  - Application uses Provider pattern for state management
  - Two main provider components identified: SessionProvider and LocalTranscriptionProvider
  - Navigation using MaterialApp with two main routes: HomeScreen and SettingsScreen
  - External packages for transcription: vosk_flutter and whisper_flutter_new
  - UI using Material 3 design system
  - Custom UI components from external repository (aqua-design-system)

## Implementation Status
- 🔄 Currently exploring provider implementations to understand state management
- 🔄 Investigating transcription model integration
- ⬜ Detailed flowchart of application data flow
- ⬜ Component interaction documentation
- ⬜ User journey mapping

## Timeline
