# Transcription App Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## Overview
A Flutter-based mobile application that performs offline speech-to-text transcription using local models (Vosk for real-time streaming and Whisper for post-recording higher accuracy). The app provides a simple, chat-like interface for users to record, view, and manage transcriptions.

## Target Platform
- Initial focus: Android APK for testing
- Future expansion: iOS (potential)

## Core Features

### Authentication
- No account creation required

### Model Selection
- Choose between Vosk (real-time streaming transcription) and Whisper (post-recording, high-accuracy transcription)
- All processing happens on device; no API key or internet connection required

### Audio Recording & Transcription
- Record button at bottom of screen for audio capture
- Vosk model: live streaming transcription while recording
- Whisper model: processes audio after recording stops for higher accuracy
- Automatic paragraph breaks for long speech segments

### Transcription Management
- Transcriptions displayed as chat-like bubbles
- Individual copy functionality for each transcription block
- Swipe-to-delete gesture for individual transcription blocks
- "Clear All" button to remove all transcriptions
- "Copy All" button to copy entire transcript
- Session Organizer: group transcriptions into named sessions
- Create, rename, delete, and switch between sessions
- Unlimited transcriptions per session

### Data Storage
- All transcription data stored and encrypted at rest locally on device
- No external database or cloud storage required
- Sessions and their transcriptions are stored (and encrypted) locally
- Session state (active session) is remembered across app restarts

### Settings
- Simple settings menu
- Select transcription model (Vosk or Whisper) and view model initialization status
- (Optional) Basic app preferences

## UI/UX Requirements
- Clean, minimalistic interface
- Chat-style transcript display
- Prominent record button
- Intuitive gesture controls
- Visual feedback during recording process
- Error messaging for API issues
- Hideable sidebar for session navigation
- “New Session” button in the sidebar
- Long‑press to rename and swipe‑to‑delete sessions

## Technical Requirements
- Flutter framework
- Local secure storage for API key
- Audio recording capabilities
- Clipboard integration

## Success Criteria
- Simple user setup process
- Accurate transcription results
- Fast response time
- Intuitive UI requiring minimal user training
- Users can manage sessions (create/rename/delete) within the sidebar
- Switching sessions immediately filters the displayed transcript
- Sessions (and their contents) persist after quitting and relaunch

- Simple user setup process
- Accurate transcription results
- Fast response time
